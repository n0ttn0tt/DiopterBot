# DiopterBot
A Discord bot that calculates glasses diopter strength based on centimeter measurements and vice versa

~~The code is complete spaghetti, but it works. If the bot had more planned functions I would parse input better and make it scaleable.~~

Now with slash commands, input is parsed loads better and the spaghetti is down significantly.

## Hosting the bot
Create a file called 'key.py' in the same directory as diopterbot2 and create a variable called TOKEN with your Discord auth token

`> key.py`
`TOKEN = 'token goes here'`

Optionally create a file called 'easter_eggs.txt', with an easter egg on each line to be displayed when someone requests something silly
